# Briefcase  📦
### Organize & Upload your photos & videos to AWS S3

![Alt text](screenshots/landing.png?raw=true "Landing View")

### Installation
As a react native app, it needs the react native boiler-plate: 
check this out https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html


### Debugging
If you want to run/debug using Android, I recommend setting up the 
Android Studio and spin up an emulator instance.
You will need to setup a device in AVD Manager https://youtu.be/3UNlzsfTqi4

Alternatively, you can just connect an actual device to your machine

After the upload is completed, the file structure in the S3 bucket will look like this:
* /bucket/
  * uploads/..../selectedFolderPath/
    * 2016/
      * October/
        * somePhoto1.png
        * someVideo1.mpg
      * December/
        * somePhoto2.jpg
        * someVideo2.avi
    * 2019/
      * February/
        * somePhoto2.png
        * someVideo2.mpg
      * April/
        * somePhoto3.jpg
        * somePhoto75.jpg
        * somePhoto3.gif


### AWS Setup
Currently the application requires that you have already created a bucket on AWS S3 https://aws.amazon.com/s3/

Having done that, you can either edit the `secrets.js` file 
in the root directory and provide the S3 data :


```javascript 
const AwsOptions = {
  keyPrefix: 'uploads/briefcase/',
  bucket: 'your-bucket-name',
  region: 'your-region',
  accessKey: 'aws-access-key',
  secretKey: 'aws-secret-key',
  successActionStatus: 201,
};
```

or use the settings inside the application:

Using 2 different buttons for Photos and Videos as an (ugly) workaround for CameraRoll's assetType
filter not working properly on Android. https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/11877



### Next steps
* Mark files for deletion after successful upload to cloud
* Previewing files
* Option to encrypt files before uploading to S3
* Check for Network change and if no longer in wi-fi
* User geo location tags based on the file metadata
* Option to 'freeze' upload folder, setting Glacier S3 setting

####Caveat : 

When running the app in debug mode on Windows, make sure that in : `react-native-background-fetch -> package.json`

the `postlink` and `postunlink` commands under rnpm are deleted or 'commented out'

eg: 

```
  "rnpm": {
    "commands": {
      "postlinkCOMMENT": "node_modules/react-native-background-fetch/scripts/postlink.js",
      "postunlinkCOMENT": "node_modules/react-native-background-fetch/scripts/postunlink.js"
    }
  },
```

Otherwise linking the package (react-native-packground-fetch) will not work on Windows 10 and fail with `Error: spawn UNKNOWN`
something similar to https://github.com/auth0/react-native-lock/issues/86


TODO: make a fork of that repo and conditionally run those commands based on OS
